<p><b><big>Experience</p></b></big>
<p><big>As I told in About Me, I have an experience of being a part-time worker at a boutique. Here, I insert some proofs.</big></p>

<p align="center">This is the boutique where I worked as a part time worker twice.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="image/dress.jpg" alt= "dress"></center>
<p align="center">This is the dress that I decorate it with beads and it is one of the dress that is hard to work on it because once I put the beads at the wrong place,<br>then it will become as a reject dress. This is because there's no way to take the beads out since there's a tool specialize to put the beads on the dress.<br>Usually I'm not the person who in charged to decorate this dress but I took the chance to decorate it on my last day of work and it turned out well as picture above!</p>
<br>
<center><img src="image/blouse.jpg" alt="blouse"></center>
<p align="center">So, usually this types of clothes that I'm in charged to decorate it with ribbon and buttons.<br>Basically all designs that need to decorate with ribbon and button are my works.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="image/ribbon.jpg" alt="ribbon"></center>
<p align="center">All ribbons and buttons are handmade and all of it were done by me.<br>I'm the one who cut the cloth for every colour needed and I sew it and made ribbons from it.</p>
